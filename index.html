<p id="bio">After surviving 29 years in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, I moved to Sedona, Arizona.  For 2.5 years I tended bar at a beautiful restaurant called The Hudson, I hiked with my dog, Navi, and practiced music. I moved to Phoenix to be with my amazing girlfriend.  During a brief period in between jobs, I began to study html css and javascript on my own.  I made some progress, but did not know where to go next, and then the restaurant I was hired at opened, I was rudely awakened from my dream of a new career in web development/coding.  Not anymore though!</p>
